-------------------------
## Contents
1. An **index.html** file, which will be used to launch the website locally.
2. **Folders** containing all images, JavaScript files, pages, and style sheets for the site.
3. A folder containing **Balsamiq wireframes** that demonstrate what the website should look like.

## Instructions for Local Execution
1. **Extract** or **move** all files in this folder to a directory of your choosing.
2. Open the **index.html** file.
3. The site should now be **fully navigable**.

## Possible Issues
1. If a page's **HTML file is not found**, check that all HTML files are located in the pages/ subdirectory.
2. If **images are not displaying**, check that all SVG and PNG files are located in the images/ subdirectory.
3. If **pages are not formatted or colored properly**, check that all CSS files are located in the styles/ subdirectory.
4. If **functions on the page are not working** as expected, check that all JS files are located in the javascript/ subdirectory.
5. A visually and functionally identical version of this project is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed **if local execution has problems** (though this is not anticipated). This is located at https://24fan.github.io/
